My Python solutions to the Advent of Code 2022

Spoiler Alert (obviously)! I highly recommend that you try these challenges for yourself before looking at any other people's solutions.

Please note that, as I am currently very busy, my aim is not to come up with an efficient solution nor to write beautiful code. I just want something that works and doesn't run for too long, that's it. So, don't come here looking for a design award candidate.

As (should be) stated in the license: Feel absolutely free to do whatever (legal!) things you want the code. If you choose to use it, then making sure that the code does what you want it to is your responsibility, however.
